AiR = Advanced iReport

I want to make it to be "Advanced Calibration Platform". But I just like AiR name.

Common = common source code referenced by AiR, AiR Mono or AiR Lite

AiR Lite = Loading Calibration Result -> Print Report = current EMU
AiR Mono = Loading Calibration Result -> Straight Forward ETE Control = Semi-Auto EMU
AiR = Loading Calibration Result -> User Interactive to resolve runtime dependencies -> Control Equipment -> Calculation -> Update Progress -> Store Result -> Print Report = current STE.

All function test or unit test are associated with individual project, not in the "IntegrationTest" or "ModularFunctionTest" folders.
